from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Spark XML Example").getOrCreate()

df = spark.read.csv("dbfs:/FileStore/annual.csv")

# repartitioning the dataFrame into a single partition and save as a single xml file with gzip compression
df.repartition(1).write.format("xml") \
  .option("compression", "gzip") \
  .save("gs://bkt-d-use1-lcef-target/xml_output_hello.xml.gz")

spark.stop()


This above code is giing two files in the output as _SUCCESS
0 B	application/octet-stream	Aug 23, 2023, 6:48:34 PM	Standard	Aug 23, 2023, 6:48:34 PM		
part-00000.gz
334.2 KB	application/octet-stream	Aug 23, 2023, 6:48:33 PM	Standard	Aug 23, 2023, 6:48:33 PM

But I want only part-00000.gz produced in the output, modify the code accordingly
